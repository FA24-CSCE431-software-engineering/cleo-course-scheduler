## Introduction to our Project

Our team is creating a degree planner application for Texas A&M University students called Cleo. Students can create a user profile based on their interests and will be recommended courses to take in their upcoming semesters. 

## Requirements

What is needed to run and code our test:

- Ruby ~ 3.3.3
- Rails ~ 7.2.1
- PostgreSQL ~ 14.13
- Ruby Gems ~ Listed in ‘Gemfile’

## External dependencies

- Docker - Download latest version at https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- Heroku CLI - Download latest version at https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
- Git - Download latest version at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

## Documentation
Our [product and sprint backlog](https://asp500.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/A5/boards/2) can be found in Jira, with project name asp-500

## Installation

### Setting up the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/FA24-CSCE431-software-engineering/cleo-course-scheduler.git
```

If you have already cloned and would like to update locally

```
git stash (if you have any changes)
git pull origin main
```

### Running Docker

Navigate to the app directory and create a docker container.
```
docker run -it --volume "${PWD}:/directory" -e DATABASE_USER=cleo_app -e DATABASE_PASSWORD=cleo_password -p 3000:3000 paulinewade/csce431:latest
```

*Note: replace directory with where the app code is located

If you want to re-enter an existing container 

```
docker start -ai determined_dubinsky
```

*Note: replace determined_dubinsky with the name of the docker container

### Installing Dependencies
```
bundle install && rails webpacker:install
```

### Configuring PostgreSQL
If no has been created database yet, run the following
```
rails db:create && rails db:migrate
```

Navigate to the ```lib``` folder, and run the following to scrape the course catalog
```
./run_spiders.sh
```

With the generated csv files, run the following to seed the database
```
rails db:seed
```

## Testing

We used RSpec and the RSpec test suite can be ran using:
```rspec spec/```

You can run all the tests by using the following command. This runs all tests, including integration and unit tests:
```rspec .```

## Code Execution

Run the following code in Powershell or regular terminal if using Windows or Linux/Mac OS respectively:

Navigate to project directory
```
cd cleo-course-scheduler
```

Run the app
```
rails s --binding:0.0.0.0
```

This application can be viewed by writing the following in your browser
```http://localhost:3000/```

## Environmental Variables/Files

Follow this Google Oauth [configuration guide](​​https://medium.com/@tony.infisical/guide-to-using-oauth-2-0-to-access-google-apis-dead94d6866d) to generate a ```GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID``` and ```GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET```, which will be used for authentication.

To enable it locally, create a ```.env``` file in the root project directory. The file should look like the following:
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="..."
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
```
Replace the ellipses with your own secrets/

The instructions for setting the environment variables on Heroku can be found below.


## Deployment

The following steps will result in the deployment of a Heroku Pipeline.
1. Setup a [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/) account
2. From the Heroku dashboard select `New` -> `Create New Pipeline`
3. Name the pipeline, and link the respective git repository to the pipeline
4. Select `Enable Review Apps`
5. Click `New app` under review apps, and link the test branch from your repo
6. Under staging app, select `Create new app` and link the main branch from your repo

### Deployment Environment Variables
To enable Google Oauth2, head over to the settings tab on the pipeline dashboard. 

1. Scroll down until `Reveal config vars`
2. Add your client id and secret id
```
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

Now once your pipeline has built the apps, select `Open app` to open the app.

## CI/CD

Continuous integration was employed through the use of Github actions. Our workflow includes:
- RSpec integration and feature tests
- Rubocop linting
- Brakeman tests

Continuous Development was setup through Heroku which has been linked to our Github repositories. The pipeline includes:
- Review application through ```test``` branch
- Production application through ```main``` branch
