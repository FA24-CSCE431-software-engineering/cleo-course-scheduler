  <h1>Manage Track</h1>

  <p>This page allows you to manage tracks. Each entry has a <strong>Name</strong> and two actions: Edit and Delete.
     The Edit action lets you change the name of an entry, while the Delete action allows you to remove an entry. 
     <strong>Note:</strong> Once you delete an entry, it will be permanently removed.</p>

  <h2>Create Track</h2>
  <p>To create a new track, enter the name in the <strong>Track Name</strong> field. Once youâ€™re satisfied, click 
     <strong>Create Track</strong>, and your new entry will appear in the <strong>Existing Tracks</strong> table.</p>
